Run automatically a code in raspberry after startup / boot:
https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=135545
_________________________________________________________________________________

	sudo nano /etc/rc.local

in this script just above last line (above exit) add this line

	cam.sh &

This will run my_start_up_cb_script.sh every time you boot.
You can name script as you like, but save it in /usr/local/bin/ folder

	sudo nano /usr/local/bin/cam.sh

than paste in this:

	#! /bin/bash
	cd /home/pi/Desktop/cam
	python cam.py     #run your command
	exit

When you save this script it is IMPORTANT that you make it executable

	sudo chmod a+x usr/local/bin/cam.sh

About shuting it down, you will have to
1/ log into rpi,
2/ OR you can make a button (if you are a bit of DIY guy) and add a script to shutdown
3/ OR buy premade power on/of button for raspberry pi
4/ OR just disconnect the cable, BUT this will lead to SD card to became corrupted faster...
